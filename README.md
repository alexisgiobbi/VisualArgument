# VisualArgument
Visual Argument constructed using GIMP software

## Project Introduction

My idea for my visual argument is to bring awareness to the normalization of binge drinking in college, and to encourage those that are struggling to seek help. I want to use big, eye-catching words that will be easy to read and grab attention, and I also don't want to alienate my audience by making it too accusatory. 

### First Draft: 
I have the basic ideas down for my preview, but gimp is super confusing to me, so I'll be working on the design and layout of it a lot more before my final draft.

## Full Draft
I have kept the same text and basic idea, and expanded upon the design elements, utilizing rhythm and GIMP tools liked paints, drop shadow, lasso tool, resizing, blending, etc. Old images were discarded, new images added.
