# VisualArgument
Visual Argument constructed using GIMP software

## Project Introduction

My idea for my visual argument is to bring awareness to the normalization of binge drinking in college, and to encourage those that are struggling to seek help. 

I have the basic ideas down for my preview, but gimp is super confusing to me, so I'll be working on the design and layout of it a lot more before my final draft.
