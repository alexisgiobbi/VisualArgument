# VisualArgument
Visual Argument constructed using GIMP software

## Project Introduction

My idea for my visual argument is to bring awareness to the normalization of binge drinking in college, and to encourage those that are struggling to seek help. I want to use big, eye-catching words that will be easy to read and grab attention, and I also don't want to alienate my audience by making it too accusatory. 

I picture this as a physical flyer, although it could be digital, placed in high-traffic areas around campus specifically to draw attention and raise awareness.
