# Reflection Overview
In this project, I really wanted to keep in mind my end goal: to argue that binge drinking in college is too normalized, and encourage those struggling to reevaluate and seek help. In my final version, I’ve utilized 20+ layers to create an attention-grabbing flyer that I think is visually appealing and effective in conveying its message.



## My process

I really wanted to utilize the picture-superiority effect. In my first draft below, you can see that the pictures aren’t really adding directly to the narrative of the flyer. I knew I wanted to create rhythm to guide the reader’s eye across the page, so I used that paint tool, but I wasn’t precisely sure how yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think my final draft is much more successful at utilizing the picture-superiority, as the road and pictures take up the majority of the paper and they tell a story of a descent into “rock bottom.” I also utilized visual rhythm by importing that winding road and creating the appearance of the person falling spliced between the “ROAD” letters. This is where I spent most of my time creating. I used the paint and blend tools for the yellow and red coloring around the road, which also further pictures that descent, and the color selector tool to match the road outline to the text color. I used the fuzzy select, free select, and scissors tool to cut out the falling man. I originally cut out all of the white, but actually found it simulated more of that “falling” 3D effect if I left the white on just one side of his body, which is why I left it this way. I used drop shadow and embossing effects on the overlapping text layers to really make them stand out, especially on the road because I wanted to make sure it was readable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I played around with adding more background images or effects, but I found that the whitespace (or in this case, black space) was necessary to draw the eyes of the reader to the text and the road, and to prevent the flyer from looking too busy. I also originally had brandy glasses throughout the road, but discovered that the road was becoming too densely populated. I opted for simplicity, and drew the bottle which is pouring the liquid out into the road. I think this really helps bridge the text at the top with the rest of the image, so I’m happy with its inclusion.

Finally, the number to call was not something I included in my original design, and realized I was severely lacking a resource to start with, so it was my final inclusion, and I’m proud of the way it ties together the message and visuals.
